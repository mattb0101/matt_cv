                    This used a wide range of skills to get done, some of which I learnt along the way. The 
                    whole project took around 4 months but I am now very happy with the outcome and I have 
                    now started to use the printer for lots of new projects.

                    I have recently released a beta version of an open source database documentation software.
                    The software uses the DBML standard to generate a database documentation site based on a
                    .DBML file. My goals with the project was to create a tool I can use myself for other 
                    projects I have planned but I was so happy with the end result that I decided to make the 
                    project public. The software is completely written in ReactJS and my plan is to make it more 
                    community driven in the future.
